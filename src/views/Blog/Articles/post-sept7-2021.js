      <p>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have taken the world of art by storm with unimaginable popularity, reporting $2.5 billion in sales volume in the first half of 2021. Some experts have attributed the sudden rise of NFTs to celebrities joining the market. They include Rappers Jay-Z and Snoop Dog, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban among others. As the digital representations of any form of artwork based on a blockchain, an NFT has some inherent unique value that cannot be edited, neither can it be duplicated without the owner’s authorization. The NFTs industry is still at its developmental stage, but one category that is currently taking the world of NFTs is the space collectibles- unique planetary NFTs that you can mine with Cardano’s ADA. Recently, a discovery-based NFT platform, Space Tokens, has emerged with some exciting features and opportunities for the crypto community. </p>
      <h5>What is Space Tokens?</h5>
      <p>Space Tokens is a discovery-based NFT platform build and run on Cardano Blockchain. The platform lets you send expeditions into galaxies to discover new and unique planetary NFTs. Space Tokens’ goal is to make it possible for ordinary people to explore space and discover some of the universe’s most precious items, something that’s nearly impossible for them in real-world expeditions.</p>
      <p>The truth is, just a few names such as Neil Armstrong, Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos have either made it to space or made it possible to go to space, with billions of dollars spent on these missions. However, as opposed to the real-world exploration that does not guarantee returns, Space Tokens galaxy expeditions has an assured return from your mission with some newly minted planet NFTs.</p>
      <h5>How Space Tokens works</h5>
      <p>Space Tokens is hosted on the Cardano Network, and with the help of Cardano wallet and ADA, you can get started with your galaxy expedition. With the platform, you don’t need billions of dollars to explore the galaxy and discover unique planetary NFTs. All you need is to supply your expedition with ADA to enable them to explore and discover unique planetary NFTs. The more ADA you supply them, the further your space cadets can travel, explore and discover. The result is an exotic and rare planet you can add to your discoveries. </p>
      <p>Space Tokens has listed over 26 different planets types that your cadets can travel and discover with a maximum of 25,000 planets available. Each planet has its own unique characteristics with tons of planetary NFTs to discover. To add icing to the cake, the platform is offering the first 2,500 expeditions on the platform a limited-edition Founder’s NFT. </p>
      <p>Space Tokens allows you to keep track of all your discoveries from the “My Expeditions” page, which you can show off by sharing the permalinks all over the internet (e.g. blogs and social media) for more market exposure. The planets will be stored on the Cardano blockchain forever. </p>
      <h5>Why Cardano?</h5>
      <p>Although Ethereum pioneered the NFTs world, its weaknesses are real barriers to the expanding popularity of NFTs. Ethereum is built on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocol that is not scalable for mass adoption. Even if they do, as they promise with their planned shift to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol, they will still lack the mechanics to recreate the space for seamless galaxy exploration with minimal cost. </p>
      <p>Ethereum will still have its space in the world of NFTs, however, we strongly believe that the future of galaxy NFTs lies on research-driven protocols that are built to scale for mass adoption targeting billions of users, like Cardano. The latter already runs on PoS protocol, which is faster, hence cheaper. The whole blockchain is set to make your exploration more affordable in terms of gas fees as you seek to discover some of the most unique planetary NFTs. </p>
      <h5>What’s more?</h5>
      <p>Space Tokens team is currently developing its intergalactic currency token. As the native token, it will be used for NFT bonuses and the purchase of expedition upgrades. They are also setting up airdrops for early purchases, and they will be made available soon. </p>
